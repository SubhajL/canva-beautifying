# Playwright UI - Final Solution

## The Root Cause
The Playwright UI was failing to load tests because:
1. The `webServer` configuration was trying to start the dev server automatically
2. The dev server was returning HTTP 500 errors repeatedly
3. This caused Playwright to get stuck in a retry loop, preventing the UI from loading tests

## The Solution

I've created a separate Playwright configuration specifically for UI mode that bypasses the webServer issue.

### Step 1: Start Your Dev Server Manually
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run Playwright UI
In a new terminal:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## What This Does

1. **Uses a separate config** (`playwright.ui.config.ts`) that doesn't have webServer configuration
2. **Checks if dev server is running** before starting the UI
3. **Loads environment variables** from `.env.local` automatically
4. **Bypasses all startup issues** that were preventing tests from loading

## Alternative Commands

If you still have issues, you can also run:

```bash
# Direct command with UI config
npx playwright test --ui --config=playwright.ui.config.ts

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/01-auth.spec.ts --headed

# Run with HTML reporter
npx playwright test --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

## Files Created/Modified

1. **playwright.ui.config.ts** - Special config for UI mode without webServer
2. **scripts/playwright-ui.sh** - Updated to use the new config and check dev server
3. **playwright.config.ts** - Modified to always reuse existing server

## Important Notes

- Always start your dev server (`npm run dev`) before running Playwright UI
- The UI mode now assumes the dev server is already running at http://localhost:3000
- This bypasses the automatic server startup that was causing the loading issues
