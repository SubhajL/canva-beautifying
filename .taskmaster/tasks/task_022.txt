# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Enhancement Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the four-stage enhancement pipeline as specified in section 6.2 of the PRD.
# Details:
1. Implement initial analysis stage using vision models
2. Create enhancement planning stage using LLMs
3. Develop asset generation stage using diffusion models
4. Implement final composition stage
5. Create pipeline orchestration
6. Develop stage transition handling
7. Implement error recovery mechanisms
8. Create pipeline monitoring and logging
9. Develop pipeline optimization
10. Implement caching for intermediate results

# Test Strategy:
Test complete enhancement pipeline with various document types. Verify each stage produces correct outputs. Test error recovery by simulating failures at each stage. Verify pipeline performance meets the <30 second requirement. Test caching effectiveness for similar documents.
