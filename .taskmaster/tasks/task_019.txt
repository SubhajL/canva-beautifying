# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement BullMQ with Redis for handling asynchronous enhancement tasks.
# Details:
1. Set up Redis via Upstash
2. Configure BullMQ for job queuing
3. Create queue for analysis jobs
4. Implement queue for enhancement jobs
5. Create queue for export jobs
6. Develop job priority system
7. Implement retry mechanisms for failed jobs
8. Create job progress tracking
9. Develop queue monitoring dashboard
10. Implement queue scaling based on load

# Test Strategy:
Test queue system with various job types. Verify jobs are processed in correct order based on priority. Test retry mechanisms by simulating failures. Verify progress tracking accurately reflects job status. Test queue performance under load.
