# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Stable Diffusion XL for Image Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Stable Diffusion XL via Replicate for generating backgrounds and decorative elements.
# Details:
1. Set up Replicate API integration
2. Create prompt engineering system for background generation
3. Implement decorative element generation
4. Create style-consistent asset generation
5. Implement image post-processing
6. Create caching system for generated assets
7. Implement fallback mechanisms for generation failures
8. Create asset categorization and tagging
9. Develop asset quality validation
10. Implement cost tracking for generation usage

# Test Strategy:
Test image generation with various prompts and styles. Verify generated assets match document style and purpose. Test caching system effectiveness. Verify fallback mechanisms work when generation fails. Test asset quality validation.
