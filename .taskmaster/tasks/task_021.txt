# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Model Selection Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop logic to select appropriate AI models based on user tier, document complexity, and processing priority.
# Details:
1. Implement model selection algorithm as specified in section 6.1
2. Create document complexity scoring
3. Develop processing priority determination
4. Implement tier-based model mapping
5. Create cost optimization logic
6. Develop fallback selection for API failures
7. Implement model performance tracking
8. Create model selection logging
9. Develop A/B testing for model selection
10. Implement dynamic model selection based on performance history

# Test Strategy:
Test model selection with various user tiers and document complexities. Verify selection follows the logic specified in section 6.1. Test fallback selection during API failures. Verify cost optimization logic selects appropriate models. Test with simulated API performance variations.
