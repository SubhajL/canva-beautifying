# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement security features to meet requirements (NFR-006 to NFR-010).
# Details:
1. Implement encryption at rest
2. Set up encryption in transit (HTTPS)
3. Create secure API key management
4. Implement CSRF protection
5. Develop input validation and sanitization
6. Create rate limiting for authentication
7. Implement IP blocking for suspicious activity
8. Develop security headers configuration
9. Create security logging and monitoring
10. Implement regular security scanning

# Test Strategy:
Test security measures with penetration testing. Verify encryption works correctly. Test CSRF protection by attempting cross-site requests. Verify input validation prevents injection attacks. Test rate limiting by simulating brute force attempts.
