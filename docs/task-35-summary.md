   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Monitor security advisories

2. **Secret Management**
   - Never commit secrets to code
   - Use environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly

3. **Monitoring**
   - Review security logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for critical events
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts

4. **Testing**
   - Run security scans before deployment
   - Perform penetration testing
   - Regular security audits
