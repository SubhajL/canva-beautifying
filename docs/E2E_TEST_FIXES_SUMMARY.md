# E2E Test Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to the e2e performance test suite to resolve authentication errors, bundle analysis issues, and EPIPE errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Errors for Free/Default Users ✅

**Problem**: Test user authentication was failing, particularly for the free tier user, causing all e2e tests to fail.

**Root Cause**:
- Supabase's `listUsers()` API was paginated with a default limit of 50 users
- The free user existed but was not in the first page of results
- User creation was failing with "email already exists" error

**Solution**:
- Created `TestUserManager` class in `/e2e/utils/test-user-manager.ts` to handle test user lifecycle
- Implemented pagination support for user lookup across all pages
- Added proper retry logic and error handling
- Updated authentication setup to ensure users exist before attempting sign-in

**Files Modified**:
- `/e2e/utils/test-user-manager.ts` (new file)
- `/e2e/setup/direct-auth.setup.ts`
- `/scripts/setup-test-users.ts`
- `package.json` (updated test:e2e:setup script)

### 2. Bundle Analysis Negative Unused Percentage ✅

**Problem**: Bundle coverage analysis was showing negative unused percentages (e.g., -86.52%).

**Root Cause**:
- JavaScript coverage data contains overlapping ranges when multiple execution paths go through the same code
- The original implementation was counting overlapping ranges multiple times, causing used size to exceed total size

**Solution**:
- Implemented `mergeOverlappingRanges()` method to consolidate overlapping coverage ranges
- Added safety check to ensure used size never exceeds file size
- Fixed calculation to properly handle coverage data

**Files Modified**:
- `/e2e/utils/performance-helpers.ts` (added range merging logic)

**Verification**:
- Created `/scripts/test-bundle-fix.ts` to verify the fix
- Bundle analysis now correctly shows 0% unused for fully utilized bundles

### 3. EPIPE Error in Test Reporter Output ✅

**Problem**: Tests were generating EPIPE errors when the reporter tried to write to closed stdout/stderr.

**Root Cause**:
- `pw-wrapper.ts` was creating detached processes and forcefully killing process groups
- Child processes were attempting to write output after their parent process was terminated

**Solution**:
- Removed `detached: true` option from process spawning
- Implemented proper cleanup handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Added EPIPE error handling in compact-pw.ts
- Made error handling more graceful to prevent propagation

**Files Modified**:
- `/scripts/pw-wrapper.ts`
- `/scripts/compact-pw.ts`

## Current Test Status

### Performance Tests
- **Landing Page Performance**: ✅ Passing (100/100 score)
- **Bundle Optimization**: ✅ Fixed and passing
- **API Response Times**: ✅ Passing
- **Memory Usage**: ✅ Within limits
- **Resource Loading**: ✅ Optimized

### Authentication
- **Free User**: ✅ Successfully authenticated
- **Pro User**: ✅ Successfully authenticated
- **Premium User**: ✅ Successfully authenticated
- **Default User**: ✅ Successfully authenticated

## Running Tests

### Setup Test Users
```bash
npm run test:e2e:setup
```

### Run Performance Tests
```bash
# Basic performance tests
npm run test:perf:basic

# Full performance suite
npm run test:perf:full

# Specific test
npx playwright test e2e/performance/basic-metrics.spec.ts --config=playwright.performance.config.ts
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Test User Management**: Test users are now managed centrally with proper error handling and retry logic
2. **Accurate Bundle Analysis**: Coverage calculation now correctly handles overlapping ranges
3. **Stable Process Management**: Test runner no longer causes EPIPE errors during cleanup
4. **Better Error Messages**: More informative logging for debugging test failures

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing test user cleanup after test runs to prevent accumulation
2. Add performance benchmarking to track metrics over time
3. Implement test result caching to speed up repeated runs
4. Add more granular performance budgets per route/component

## Technical Details

### TestUserManager API
```typescript
class TestUserManager {
  async ensureTestUserExists(tier: 'free' | 'pro' | 'premium'): Promise<TestUser>
  async validateTestCredentials(email: string, password: string): Promise<boolean>
  async resetTestUserPassword(email: string): Promise<string>
  async cleanupTestUsers(): Promise<void>
}
```

### Bundle Coverage Calculation
The fixed algorithm:
1. Collects all coverage ranges from all functions
2. Sorts ranges by start offset
3. Merges overlapping ranges
4. Calculates used size from merged ranges
5. Ensures used size doesn't exceed file size

### Process Management
The improved process spawning:
- No detached processes
- Proper signal handling
- Graceful cleanup on exit
- EPIPE error suppression
