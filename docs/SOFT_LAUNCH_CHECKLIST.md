## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] 90% of beta users complete onboarding

## 🔥 Emergency Contacts

- **Technical Issues**: [Your contact]
- **Supabase Support**: support@supabase.com
- **Cloudflare Support**: [R2 support link]
- **Payment Issues**: Stripe support

## Notes

**Current State**: The application has a complete UI/UX and beta program infrastructure, but the core enhancement engine (the main product feature) appears to be using placeholder logic. The payment system is also not connected, making it impossible for users to upgrade.

**Recommendation**: Before soft launch, prioritize:
1. Implementing actual document enhancement logic
2. Connecting payment processing
3. Thorough end-to-end testing of the enhancement pipeline
4. Setting up production environment and monitoring
