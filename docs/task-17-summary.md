## Manual Setup Required

1. **WebSocket Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5001
   ```

2. **Socket.io Installation** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install socket.io-client
   ```

3. **Navigation Update**
   - Add link to wizard from main enhancement page
   - Update navigation menu if needed

## Usage Example

Users can access the wizard at `/enhance/wizard` and follow these steps:

1. **Upload** - Drag and drop or select a document
2. **Audience** - Choose target audience and grade level
3. **Style** - Select visual style and customization options
4. **Review** - Confirm selections before processing
5. **Processing** - Watch real-time progress updates
6. **Results** - Download or share enhanced document

## Features Implemented

- **Persistent State**: Wizard state persists across page refreshes (except file data)
- **Validation**: Each step validates required fields before allowing progression
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully functional on mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for processing progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Integration Points

- **API**: Integrates with `/api/v1/enhance` endpoint
- **WebSocket**: Connects to Socket.io server for real-time updates
- **Authentication**: Uses Supabase auth context
- **Storage**: File URLs from Cloudflare R2

## Notes

- Processing step simulates real-time updates (requires WebSocket server)
- File upload currently simulates progress (actual upload happens on submit)
- Results step assumes email notification is sent by backend
- Wizard can be embedded in other pages by importing `EnhancementWizard` component
