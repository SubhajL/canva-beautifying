# Task ID: 7
# Title: Setup AI Model Integration Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a framework for integrating and switching between different AI models (Gemini, GPT-4.1, Claude).
# Details:
Implement an abstract interface for AI model interactions. Create separate modules for Gemini, GPT-4.1, and Claude integrations. Implement the model selection logic based on user tier and document complexity.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each model integration. Verify correct model selection based on different scenarios. Test fallback mechanisms and error handling.
